This app was just a practice run to get myself comfortable using react components before I try rewriting my chronos app in react.
It's visually disturbing on the browser, but the popup is fulling functioning react components, that when interacted with, trigger actions in the tab, passing variables through chrome.storage. It also has a get call to a photo library.
